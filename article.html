The cycle of curiosity.

Before I start anything here,there's a random saying I heard  about being honest with yourself or rather trying to sync with the object of your motivation.
“If the rhymes are not rhyming -and you keep rhyming;it had better be worth the rhyme”…..From the unknown poet.

Full disclosure;In the case of this article, when I invoke the memory of the unknown poet,please understand that I am only looking through the mirror,noting what i see from the reflection and as a result mostly referencing myself.I am also alluding to a harbored fleeting uncertainty perambulating through the netherworlds of consciousness that is neither held as possessed knowledge or administered as actual fact.In other words -my undecided  feelings.

Essentially,I believe the saying is about being confident in your thoughts and or pursuits and stacking that up against the idealized expectation mapp.If you have to hold still,you had better not hold longer than is necessary or run the risk of your pursuit being ineffectual. 

An anthology of conscious thought.: Before starting something.

My writing shall be calibrated in the manner of days -preceding the idiomatic D- Day.The moment everyone gets to launch the object of what it is they are baking to friends , acquaintances-the world.

I am talking about myself mostly here .So get ready;-a drumroll please;
Day one.
I know it sounds cliche,but when that Eureka moment strikes-The traffic seems to grind to a halt,the sky may seem to change its color and the heart may seem to work overtime.This is my anachronistic way of saying; human nature  has tagged you -catch that breath please.

That “timeline” that precedes immediately before launching an anything;-Before that proposal that got rejected;leaving you between the netherworlds of happiness and sadness or that proposal that got accepted; leaving you so poetic ,you thought you were “the blissful canopy of happiness personified”.-


That time the question lingered ;Surely,I can run for office,.before telling your buddy later in the day;Guess who is running for governor- I am paraphrasing a former vice president .

Day two.
It’s essentially about being star struck by the trailblazers and awe struck at how much work needed to be done ;actual or imagined.This sense of gratuitous wonderment transitively devolves into the peripheral assignment of rationalizing, the mindset of the people who have “been there,done that”.
You are reminded that the  industry is as gigantic as the audacity of its godfathers is impressive.There is the juxtaposition that ever questions the essence of rational detail.;The imperative of actionable routes.

Day three.Just take the logic turn , follow the lectern of success authored by the leaders of the pack and hey ;Do the “right thing” and run wild and out.

Conclusion.
When it comes down to simplicity,it boils down to what makes you happy;Far from counting the days.

Till then.

          <p>To open or not to open.

In a highly competitive world,moving forward isn't much about hanging out with  the sisters,or the bros or the girls,as it is about seizing opportunity with anyone that chance presents. 

Inner circuits within peripheral tribal rings do work and could pay dividends however they are self sabotaging in the event one finds  difficulty  breaking off the local circuiting environment such as a race or gender group due to an inscribed redundancy.


Once upon a time , a  girl in her senior year held the huge glass door open and patiently waited as a boy she had never spoken to,in his junior year-passed  by.

Big deal huh(it normally isn't,The cache,she didn't need to)

He was impressed though .


He nodded a thanks,gave her that solemn gaze  of inner approval ,blessed her in his heart and went about his  business.


Three years later,he meets her on the street;he buys her a coffee and they get to talk some more.


She had just gotten a prestigious  grant  -The happiness was mutual as he learned  how kind life had been to her.What she hadn't realized was that he was the one who had anonymously recommended her.


Why am I saying this?

Life isn't linear so the results of character may differ however standing on the good side is usually more safer than otherwise 

Normalize holding doors open for people  regardless of gender ,assumed status or what you believe you stand to gain .



It may be their good pleasure to do the same for you sometime when opportunity presents itself.


He was glad the world normalized  opening doors for her.

It wasn't about femininity or masculinity but rather doing what was right and kind at that moment.


We agree we are not necessarily talking about literal doors here.</p>
