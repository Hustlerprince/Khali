The cycle of curiosity.

Before I start anything here,there's a random saying I heard  about being honest with yourself or rather trying to sync with the object of your motivation.
“If the rhymes are not rhyming -and you keep rhyming;it had better be worth the rhyme”…..From the unknown poet.

Full disclosure;In the case of this article, when I invoke the memory of the unknown poet,please understand that I am only looking through the mirror,noting what i see from the reflection and as a result mostly referencing myself.I am also alluding to a harbored fleeting uncertainty perambulating through the netherworlds of consciousness that is neither held as possessed knowledge or administered as actual fact.In other words -my undecided  feelings.

Essentially,I believe the saying is about being confident in your thoughts and or pursuits and stacking that up against the idealized expectation mapp.If you have to hold still,you had better not hold longer than is necessary or run the risk of your pursuit being ineffectual. 

An anthology of conscious thought.: Before starting something.

My writing shall be calibrated in the manner of days -preceding the idiomatic D- Day.The moment everyone gets to launch the object of what it is they are baking to friends , acquaintances-the world.

I am talking about myself mostly here .So get ready;-a drumroll please;
Day one.
I know it sounds cliche,but when that Eureka moment strikes-The traffic seems to grind to a halt,the sky may seem to change its color and the heart may seem to work overtime.This is my anachronistic way of saying; human nature  has tagged you -catch that breath please.

That “timeline” that precedes immediately before launching an anything;-Before that proposal that got rejected;leaving you between the netherworlds of happiness and sadness or that proposal that got accepted; leaving you so poetic ,you thought you were “the blissful canopy of happiness personified”.-


That time the question lingered ;Surely,I can run for office,.before telling your buddy later in the day;Guess who is running for governor- I am paraphrasing a former vice president .

Day two.
It’s essentially about being star struck by the trailblazers and awe struck at how much work needed to be done ;actual or imagined.This sense of gratuitous wonderment transitively devolves into the peripheral assignment of rationalizing, the mindset of the people who have “been there,done that”.
You are reminded that the  industry is as gigantic as the audacity of its godfathers is impressive.There is the juxtaposition that ever questions the essence of rational detail.;The imperative of actionable routes.

Day three.Just take the logic turn , follow the lectern of success authored by the leaders of the pack and hey ;Do the “right thing” and run wild and out.

Conclusion.
When it comes down to simplicity,it boils down to what makes you happy;Far from counting the days.

Till then.
